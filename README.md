# About Me, Mikael

👋 Hi there! I'm Mikael, a backend developer with experience in Kotlin and TypeScript.

🔧 Since 2021, I've been creating Minecraft plugins using the **Bukkit API** with **Kotlin** as my main language.
📅 From December 2022 to March 2024, I worked at a tech company as a backend and frontend developer, building web apps with TypeScript.

💻 Nowadays, I primarily work with **Kotlin**, developing backend solutions.
