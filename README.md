Hey! My name is Mikael and I'm from Brazil. I'm a Kotlin and React developer.
I've programmed a lot with Kotlin over the past 2 years (since 2021) creating plugins for Minecraft servers (using the Bukkit API). Nowadays I create websites with React (TS/JS), mainly backend.
Sometimes I still program some plugins, just to kill the nostalgia. To this day, Kotlin is still the language I most enjoyed using in my life as a programmer, and it has also accompanied an important part of my career as a programmer ❤.
