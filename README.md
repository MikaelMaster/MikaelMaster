# About me - Mikael

👋 Hello! I'm a backend developer specializing in **Kotlin**, with a primary focus on developing backends using **Ktor** and **Exposed** to build scalable and robust APIs. In addition, I integrate my Ktor backends with frontends developed in **React** and **NextJS** using **TypeScript**, creating dynamic and modern interfaces.

💾 **Databases:** I have solid experience with relational databases (SQL) and caching systems like **Redis**, consistently applying best practices to optimize application performance.

🚀 **How It All Started:** My development journey began by creating **Minecraft plugins** and **mods** using **Kotlin** and **Java** with the **Bukkit/Spigot APIs**. This early experience helped me build a strong foundation in programming logic and event-driven development.

💻 **Technologies I Use:** While my main focus is backend development with **Kotlin**, I'm constantly expanding my skills and exploring new technologies to deliver comprehensive, integrated solutions.
